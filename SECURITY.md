## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in disclosing them responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email to: **[security@project-email.com]**

Include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours.
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.
- **Progress Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress weekly.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
- We will keep you informed throughout the investigation and resolution process.
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
- We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you.

## Security Best Practices

When using this project, please follow these security guidelines:

### Environment Security

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys, tokens, or credentials to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables or secure configuration files
3. **Docker Security**: Keep Docker images updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for known vulnerabilities

### Data Security

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Data Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging for security monitoring

### Model Security

1. **Model Validation**: Verify model integrity and provenance
2. **Prompt Injection**: Be aware of prompt injection attacks
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure training data doesn't contain sensitive information
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Features

This project includes several built-in security features:

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Content Filtering**: Built-in content filtering to prevent harmful outputs
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control system
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers for web interfaces
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging and monitoring

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM-Specific Risks

- **Prompt Injection**: Users may attempt to manipulate model behavior through crafted prompts
- **Data Leakage**: Models may inadvertently reveal training data or system information
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Specially crafted inputs may cause unexpected model behavior

### Mitigation Strategies

- Input validation and sanitization
- Output filtering and monitoring
- Rate limiting and usage quotas
- Regular security audits and testing

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2)
- Documented in the changelog with security impact
- Announced through GitHub security advisories
- Communicated via email to maintainers

## Community Security

We encourage the community to:

- Report security issues responsibly
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow security best practices
- Participate in security discussions

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:

- OWASP security guidelines
- Common security frameworks and standards
- Data protection regulations (where applicable)
